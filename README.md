# Employee Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing employee data from a CSV file. The scripts focus on three specific analyses:

1. **Identifying Employees Working for 7 Consecutive Days**
   - `7_consecutive_days.py`

2. **Finding Employees with Less than 10 Hours but Greater than 1 Hour Between Shifts**
   - `less_10_greater_1.py`

3. **Identifying Employees Working for More than 14 Hours in a Single Shift**
   - `greater_14.py`

## Output

The output of the analysis scripts is stored in `output.txt`. This file consolidates the results from the three scripts:

1. **Employees Working for 7 Consecutive Days:**
   - Lists employees who have worked for 7 consecutive days.

2. **Employees with Time Between Shifts:**
   - Provides information about employees who have less than 10 hours but greater than 1 hour between shifts.

3. **Employees with Long Shifts:**
   - Identifies employees who have worked for more than 14 hours in a single shift.

Each section in `output.txt` is clearly labeled, making it easy to identify the results of each specific analysis.
